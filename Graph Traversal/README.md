# Introduction to Algorithm

## Definition  
An algorithm is a sequence of steps or instructions to solve a problem.

## Graph Data Structure  
Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path and detecting cycles.

### Graph  
A **graph data structure** is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships between different entities.

> **Note:** A **Tree** is a special type of Graph.

### Online Graph Editor  
You can use an online graph editor here: [Graph Editor](https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/)

## Tree vs Graph  
| Feature      | Tree | Graph |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Cycle       | Not possible | Possible |
| Multiple Edges | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Pathways   | Only one way | Multiple ways |
| Edge Direction | One way | All ways |

##Graph Traversal
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search) Level-wise
- **DFS (Depth-First Search) Depth-wise  

## Graph Examples  
- **Google Maps** (Finding shortest paths)  
- **Facebook Mutual Friends** (Social network connections)

## Graph Representation  
Graphs can be represented and stored in three ways:  
1. **Adjacency Matrix**  
2. **Adjacency List**  
3. **Edge List**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency Matrix  
An adjacency matrix is an **N x N** square matrix (where **N** is the number of nodes) used to represent connections between vertices.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency List  
An adjacency list is a data structure where each node in the graph maintains a list of its neighboring vertices.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Edge List  
An edge list is a simple representation of a graph where we store edges as a list of pairs (u, v). It is one of the easiest ways to represent a graph.
